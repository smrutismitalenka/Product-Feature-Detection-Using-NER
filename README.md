## Project Overview

Simplifio is a company that creates data-driven solutions for a pool of their customers. In this project we developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model with scaPy for themwith real time dataset consisting of more than 600,000 products. The product information were in Finnish and English. The goal of this project was to create a tool that will help the customer withfast orientation on these products. This project was completed as a team work for the trainingcourse Data Science and Machine Learning at Integrify.

The project includes:

* fixed_train_data.json/.txt
* train_file_custom_NER
* test_file_custom_NER
* model folder

fixed_train_data.json/txt is the training dataset in the format as required by ScaPy. It has around 1000 training examples.

train_file_custom_NER contains the information about the training process of our custom model.

The test_file_custom_NER will take you through the testing procedure that we undertook.

In the model folder, you can find the trained custom NER model with all the required files. This model can be used to test any similar unseen data.
